# Accordion

This is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation of an accordion component.

## Description

The Accordion is a user interface element that allows you to show and hide content in a collapsible manner. When a section header is clicked, it expands to reveal its content. Clicking another section header will collapse the previous one and expand the clicked section.

## Demo

## How to Use

To use the Accordion in your project, follow these steps:

1. Copy the following HTML code into your project's HTML file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your accordion code here -->
    <!-- ... -->
</body>
</html>
```

2. Create a new CSS file (e.g., `style.css`) and paste the provided CSS code to style the accordion.

3. Finally, copy the JavaScript code at the end of the HTML file, or include it in a separate JavaScript file and link it to your HTML file.

## Customization

You can customize the accordion appearance by modifying the CSS styles in the `style.css` file. The provided CSS includes classes for the accordion headers (`.accordion`), active headers (`.active`), and panel content (`.panel`).

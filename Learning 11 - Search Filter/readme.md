# Real-Time Search Filter :mag_right:

A simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript application that demonstrates a real-time search filter. The user can type in the search input, and the list of items will be dynamically filtered based on the search query. No need to click any buttons; the filtering happens instantly as you type!


## How to Use :rocket:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Type in the search input to filter the list of items in real-time.

## Features :star2:

- Real-time filtering as you type.
- Simple and intuitive interface.
- Works with any list of items.

## Technologies Used :computer:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How it Works :wrench:

The `index.html` file contains the HTML structure for the search input and the list of items. The `style.css` file provides styling for the elements, and the `app.js` file contains the JavaScript code responsible for the real-time filtering.

## Customization :art:

Feel free to customize the list items in the `index.html` file and update the styles in the `style.css` file to match your project's design.

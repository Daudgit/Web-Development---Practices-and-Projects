# City Information Tabs 🏙️

City Information Tabs is a simple web application that allows users to view information about different cities by clicking on tabs. The application provides a basic implementation of tabs to display information about four cities - London 🇬🇧, Paris 🇫🇷, Tokyo 🇯🇵, and Oslo 🇳🇴.

## Features

- Interactive tabs: Users can click on the tabs to view information about the respective cities.
- City Information: Each city tab displays the name of the city and some brief information about it.

## Explanation of Code

The project consists of three main files:

1. `index.html`: This HTML file contains the structure of the web page. It includes the container divs for each city, the tab buttons, and links to the CSS and JavaScript files.

2. `style.css`: The CSS file defines the layout and style of the web page. It sets the initial display of the city divs to "none" so that only one city is visible at a time when its respective tab is clicked. It also styles the tab buttons with different background colors based on the selected city.

3. `app.js`: The JavaScript file contains the logic for displaying the city information based on the tab clicked. The `openCity` function takes three arguments: `cityName`, `evt`, and `color`. It first hides all the city divs by setting their display property to "none". Then, it removes the background color from all tab buttons. Next, it displays the city div corresponding to the `cityName` parameter and sets the background color of the clicked tab button to the specified `color`.

## Improvements

While this is a simple project that accomplishes its purpose, there are several improvements that can be made:

1. **Responsive Design**: Add responsive design to make the application mobile-friendly and accessible on various devices.

2. **More Cities**: Expand the application to include information about more cities, allowing users to explore a wider range of places.

3. **Images and Additional Information**: Enhance the city tabs by adding images and more detailed information about each city.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to gracefully handle any unexpected issues or errors that may occur during the application's runtime.

5. **Localization**: Add support for multiple languages to cater to a broader audience.

6. **Dynamic Data**: Fetch city information from an external API or a backend server to provide dynamic and up-to-date data.

7. **Animations**: Include smooth animations when switching between city tabs to improve the user experience.

8. **Testing**: Implement automated tests to ensure the application functions as expected and to catch any regressions in future changes.

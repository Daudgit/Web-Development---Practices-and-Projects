# Animated Menu Icon :hamburger: :sparkles:

Welcome to the "Animated Menu Icon" project! This is a simple web development project that demonstrates how to create an animated menu icon using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Preview

Add a screenshot or GIF of the animated menu icon here (optional).

## Getting Started :rocket:

To view the animated menu icon in action, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/animated-menu-icon.git
```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. Click on the menu icon (the three horizontal bars) to see the animation.

## How It Works

When you click on the `div#container`, a JavaScript function is triggered. This function toggles the "change" class on the container element, which triggers CSS animations to create the animated menu icon effect.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

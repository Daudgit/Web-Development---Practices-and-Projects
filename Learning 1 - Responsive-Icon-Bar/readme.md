# :art: Responsive Icon Bar

This repository contains a simple and responsive icon bar implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The icon bar is designed to be visually appealing and interactive. :sparkles:

## :rocket: Usage

To use the icon bar, simply open the "index.html" file in a web browser. The icon bar displays four icons, each representing a different navigation link. Clicking on an icon will highlight it with a red background to indicate the active link. :computer:

- CSS: The appearance and layout of the icon bar are styled using CSS.
- JavaScript: The interactivity of the icon bar is achieved using JavaScript. :gear:
- Font Awesome (Version 6.4.0): Used for the icons in the icon bar. :font_awesome:

## :wrench: How It Works

The icon bar is implemented using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. :bulb:

### HTML
The "index.html" file contains the HTML markup for the icon bar, including the four icons as anchor tags. :anchor:

### CSS
The "style.css" file contains the CSS styles that customize the appearance of the icon bar. It sets the background color, font size, and spacing for the icon bar. Additionally, it defines the hover effect, where the icon color changes to white when the user hovers over an icon. :art:

### JavaScript
The "script.js" file contains the JavaScript code responsible for the interactivity of the icon bar. It listens for click events on the icon elements and adds the "active" class to the clicked icon while removing the "active" class from all other icons. The "active" class is used to style the active icon with a red background and a blue icon color. :sparkler: :blue_heart:

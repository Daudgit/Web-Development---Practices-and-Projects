# Responsive Icon Bar

This repository contains a simple and responsive icon bar implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The icon bar is designed to be visually appealing and interactive.

## Usage

To use the icon bar, simply open the "index.html" file in a web browser. The icon bar displays four icons, each representing a different navigation link. Clicking on an icon will highlight it with a red background to indicate the active link.

## Features

- Responsive Design: The icon bar adapts to different screen sizes, making it suitable for mobile and desktop devices.
- Hover Effect: When hovering over an icon, the color changes to white to provide visual feedback.
- Active Icon Highlight: The active icon is highlighted with a red background and a blue icon color for easy identification.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Font Awesome (Version 6.4.0)

## How It Works

The JavaScript code in "script.js" listens for click events on the icon elements. When an icon is clicked, the active class is added to the clicked icon, and all other icons have the active class removed. The CSS styles in "style.css" handle the visual appearance of the icon bar, including the active icon highlighting and hover effects.

## Credits

- Font Awesome (Version 6.4.0): Used for the icons in the icon bar.

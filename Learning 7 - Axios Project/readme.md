# Basic Node.js Project using Axios :rocket:

This is a simple Node.js project that demonstrates how to use the Axios library to make HTTP requests to an API. It fetches data from the API and logs the response to the console. :computer:

## Prerequisites :clipboard:

Before running the project, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. :gear:

## Installation :arrow_down:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nodejs-api-project.git
cd nodejs-api-project
```

2. Install the required dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage :hammer_and_wrench:

1. Open the `index.js` file.

2. Replace `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1` with the API URL you want to fetch data from. You can use any API that responds to GET requests.

3. Save the `index.js` file.

4. Run the Node.js script.

```bash
node index.js
```

5. The project will make a GET request to the specified API URL and log the response data to the console. :rocket:
